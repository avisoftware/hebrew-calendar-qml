Compiling
=========

The ctypes.pp unit was taken from FPC 1.9.8 version and was modified to contain also some floating point C equivalent. 
The FPC version 2.0 have the floating points definition. If you are using FPC version 2.0 or above please remove the unit.

Add the hdate.pp and the hdate_obj.pp (or thier .ppu files after compilation) to the path of fpc.cfg in order to use the units globally with all of your applications.

It is recommanded to use FPC 2.2.0 or above for the newer version of this library.

The ctypes.pp unit was taken from FPC 1.9.8 version and was modified to contain also some floating point C equivalent. 
I hope that version 2.0 will contains them as well, if not please keep this unit, otherwise feel free to remove it.

Add the hdate.pp and the hdate_obj.pp (or thier .ppu files after compilation) to the path of fpc.cfg in order to use 
the units globally with all of your applications.
